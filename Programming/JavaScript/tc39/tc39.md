## TC39 [Back](../JavaScript.md)

Through [the tracked lists](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) of proposals published by TC39, I hope to note some features of JavaScript and know more about JavaScript with such a note. As for proposals of JavaScript, we may need to know that a plan of any feature will always go through **FIVE** stages before published:

- **Stage 0 (Strawperson)**
- **Stage 1 (Proposal)**
- **Stage 2 (Draft)**
- **Stage 3 (Candidate)**
- [**Stage 4 (Finished)**](./stage4/stage4.md)

It is helpful to know more about such a process through the document [**here**](./process/process.md), before caring about proposals themselves.
